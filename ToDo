ToDo:
 - Add tests that require Collections.unmodifiableList()
 - Consider FunctionalInterface return types from partial functions, eg as in fold
 - Tests for all the ? super and ? extends
 - Space out the preconditions from the body
 - Lazy.skipWhile is complex, possibly more complex than required
 - Lazy.takeWhile has some suspicious code in hasNext() and next()
 - Lazy.unfold does not really need to be supplied with an Iterable of initial values
